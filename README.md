Intelligent Dungeon Crawler: A Multi-Agent System with Chatbot Assistance 

The project consists of a dungeon crawler application in which the user must conquer a fixed number of rooms presented in sequential order. Access to the next room is unlocked after
successfully completing the current one. A room is considered complete when all enemies within it are defeated. In addition, rooms can contain ”power-ups,” which are objects designed
to enhance user capabilities, such as increasing health, defense, or attack power. The final room of the dungeon will feature a ”boss,” a significantly stronger enemy compared to the standard
ones. Defeating the boss signifies the completion of the dungeon. In addition to this, a chatbot will always be available to provide interactive assistance to the user.
